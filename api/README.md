# Project Support
### Introduction
Project Support is an open source platform that enable users share causes they're passionate about and actively involved with with the hopes of connecting with other users equally interested in working with them on the given cause.
### Project Support Features
* Users can signup and login to their accounts
* Public (non-authenticated) users can access all causes on the platform
* Authenticated users can access all causes as well as create a new cause, edit their created cause and also delete what they've created.
### Installation Guide
* Clone this repository [here](https://github.com/blackdevelopa/ProjectSupport.git).
* The develop branch is the most stable branch at any given time, ensure you're working from it.
* Run npm install to install all dependencies
* You can either work with the default mLab database or use your locally installed MongoDB. Do configure to your choice in the application entry file.
* Create an .env file in your project root folder and add your variables. See .env.sample for assistance.
### Usage
* Run npm start:dev to start the application.
* Connect to the API using Postman on port 7066.
### API Endpoints
| HTTP Verbs | Endpoints | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | /api/user/signup | To sign up a new user account |
| POST | /api/user/login | To login an existing user account |
| POST | /api/causes | To create a new cause |
| GET | /api/causes | To retrieve all causes on the platform |
| GET | /api/causes/:causeId | To retrieve details of a single cause |
| PATCH | /api/causes/:causeId | To edit the details of a single cause |
| DELETE | /api/causes/:causeId | To delete a single cause |
### Technologies Used
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) This is a cross-platform runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine used in running JavaScript codes on the server. It allows for installation and managing of dependencies and communication with databases.
* [ExpressJS](https://www.expresjs.org/) This is a NodeJS web application framework.
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) This is a free open source NOSQL document database with scalability and flexibility. Data are stored in flexible JSON-like documents.
* [Mongoose ODM](https://mongoosejs.com/) This makes it easy to write MongoDB validation by providing a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model to application data.

# AirBnB clone - The RESFUL Api
![Optional Text](hbnb.png)
## Background Context
***Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!***<br>
Before starting, please read the ***AirBnB*** concept page.
### First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: `HTML/CSS templating`, `database storage`, `API`, `front-end integration`…<br>
#### Each task is linked and will help you to:
* put in place a parent class (called `BaseModel`) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
* create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
* create all classes used for AirBnB (`User`, `State`, `City`, `Place`…) that inherit from BaseModel
* create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
* create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
### What’s a command interpreter?
Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:
* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object
## More Info
### Execution
Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:
```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```
But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)
```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
```
All tests should also pass in non-interactive mode: `$ echo "python3 -m unittest discover tests" | bash`

## 0x01 Introduction
Team project to build a clone of [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com/).

The console is a command interpreter to manage objects abstraction between objects and how they are stored.

To see the fundamental background of the project visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/ralexrivero/AirBnB_clone/wiki).

The console will perform the following tasks:
* create a new object
* retrive an object from a file
* do operations on objects
* destroy an object

### Storage
All the classes are handled by the `Storage` engine in the `FileStorage` Class.

All the development and testing was runned over an operating system Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using programming language Python 3.8.3. The editors used were VIM 8.1.2269, VSCode 1.6.1 and Atom 1.58.0 . Control version using Git 2.25.1.

## 0x03 Installation
```
bash
git clone https://github.com/aysuarex/AirBnB_clone.git
```

change to the `AirBnb` directory and run the command:

```bash
 ./console.py
```

## 0x04 Testing

All the test are defined in the `tests` folder.

* Modules:

```python
python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
```

* Classes:
  
```python
python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'
```

* Functions (inside and outside a class):

```python
python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
```

and

```python
python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'
```

### Python Unit Tests

* unittest module
* File extension ``` .py ```
* Files and folders star with ```test_```
* Organization:for ```models/base.py```, unit tests in: ```tests/test_models/test_base.py```
* Execution command: ```python3 -m unittest discover tests```
* or: ```python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base.py```

### run test in interactive mode

```bash
echo "python3 -m unittest discover tests" | bash
```

### run test in non-interactive mode

To run the tests in non-interactive mode, and discover all the test, you can use the command:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover tests
```
